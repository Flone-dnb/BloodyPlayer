- Add a little (non-modal window) "Tutorial" (with pictures) on first startup: tell user to drag'n'drop, Ctrl + F, RMB to create repeat section, RMB on tracks, FX.
And if user not finished th tutorial then show it again on next start. Or, if user checked "don't show again" don't show it again.
- Speed up the process of adding the tracks.
- When adding music, we need to add it in the same order in which it was in the folder.
- Seems like with 'speed (by pitch)' effect we also need to increase mid-high frequencies on like 3-4 dB and maybe do the same thing with the low and the mid-low.
- After the tracklist was cleared volume returns to the default value of 75%, we don't want that, don't change master volume when tracklist is clear and allow to change it if tracklist is clear.
- Add winsock2 and make 'Check for Updates' button in menu (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39931347/simple-http-get-with-winsock and https://github.com/VioletGiraffe/github-releases-autoupdater).
- With winsock2 create a server and if another audio file is being opened a new instance of Player will check if one is running and if true then this new track will be sent to currently running instance. 
- Make better icons for buttons.
- Add gain (fader) DSP.
- Add multi-band EQ.
- On every startup check if the Player is associated with the audio formats in windows and if not then ask to associate.
