- Add bounds in which track will repeat by clicking RMB on the graph. Track's volume in the transition from end bound to start bound will change?
- Add a history of played tracks so the 'prev' button will get back to actually previous track even if 'random track' function is selected.
- After the tracklist was cleared volume returns to the default value of 75%, we don't want that, don't change master volume when tracklist is clear and allow to change it if tracklist is clear.
- Make better icons for buttons.
- Speed up the process of adding the tracks. Maybe do something with the bitrate calculation because the current function may be kinda slow and maybe there is a faster and easy way.
- Add multi-band EQ.
- Decrease RAM used.
