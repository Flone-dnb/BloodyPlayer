- When adding music, we need to add it in the same order in which it was in the folder.
- With winsock2 create a server and if another audio file is being opened a new instance of Player will check if one is running and if true then this new track will be sent to currently running instance. 
- (?) Add winsock2 and make 'Check for Updates' button -> in settings add "Update server address".
- Add gain (fader) DSP.
- Add multi-band EQ.
- On every startup check if the Player is associated with the audio formats in windows and if not then ask to associate.
- Seems like with 'speed (by pitch)' effect we also need to increase mid-high frequencies on like 3-4 dB and maybe do the same thing with the low and the mid-low.
